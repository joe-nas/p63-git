# The Venn diagrams are made as follows: Firstly, the BS files in a certain Venn diagrams were concatenated to one file, sorted and overlapping BS were merged and given a new unique identifier:
cat [file_1] [file_2] ... [file_n] | bedtools sort -i stdin |bedtools merge -i stdin| awk -F t '{print $1$2$3"\tpeak_"NR}' >[outputfile]
# Then each of the original files [file_1] ... [file_n] were overlapped with the [outputfile] in order to recieve the peak name which is common to the whole set of peaks.
bedtools intersect -wa -a [outputfile] -b [file_n] |cut -f 4 > [file_n_for_Venn]
# the plotting is then done in R using the package Vennerable

To plot the average chromatin signature at p63 BS, 50bp bins $\pm$1000bp around p63BS peaks were generated:
awk '{
 GLCHR = $1;
 GLSTART = $2;
 GLEND = $3;
 MIDPOINT = (GLEND-GLSTART)/2;
 GLSTART = GLSTART + MIDPOINT -1000;

 for (i = 0; i<40;i++){
  print GLCHR"\t"GLSTART+i*50"\t"GLSTART+((i+1)*50)"\tpeak_"NR"_bin"i;
 }
}' [input_file] > [bin_file]

# the output file was then overlapped with the files containing the genomic locations of chip-seq Histone reads.
bedtools intersect -c -a [bin_file] -b [histone_reads] |cut -f 4,5 > [coverage_file]
# Subsequently R was used to plot the [coverage_file]

[codechunk 4]
# To plot the number of SNPs per p63 motif bp, 1bp bins around the p63 motif were generated (similar to [codechunk 3]) and overlapped with the genomic locations of SNPs. The number of SNPs per bin were summed and finaly plotted with R.
